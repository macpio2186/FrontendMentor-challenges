## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I once again used flexbox as I'm trying to understand it well. But in the next one, I will be experimenting more with CSS Grid. I'm also learning how to use :root.

I have also managed to create a responsive website that works well on mobile devices.
